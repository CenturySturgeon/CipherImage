CipherImage is a command-line interface (CLI) utility for encrypting passwords and concealing them within images using steganography.

## Usage

### Downloading the Windows Executable

1. Make sure you're signed in to Github.
2. Go to the 'Actions' tab in this repository.
3. Find the latest workflow run and click on its name.
4. Download the zip file containing the executable.
5. Decompress the zip file and add the decompressed folder location to your path variable (you cna check this [tutorial on how to do it on Windows](https://medium.com/@kevinmarkvi/how-to-add-executables-to-your-path-in-windows-5ffa4ce61a53)).
6. If everything went right, open your terminal and type "cipherImage" (the name of the .exe without the extension) and you should see something like this: 

```
Usage: cipherImage [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  check-input    Simple function to review what it is you're writing.
  decrypt-image  Decrypts a password hiding in the provided image using a...
  encrypt-image  Encrypts a password using a key generated by the...
```

Alternatively, you don't have to add the executable to your system's path variable as you can use it directly. On Windows, you'd need to open a terminal in the same folder where the executable is and run ```call cipherImage.exe``` and you'd get the same result as above.
